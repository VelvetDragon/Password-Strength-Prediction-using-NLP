# Password Strength Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the strength of a password based on various features such as length, character frequency, and special characters. It uses machine learning techniques to classify passwords into three categories: weak, normal, and strong.

## Features
- Password strength classification based on five key factors:
  - Length of the password
  - Frequency of lowercase characters
  - Frequency of uppercase characters
  - Frequency of numeric characters
  - Frequency of special characters

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/VelvetDragon/Password-Strength-Prediction-using-NLP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Password-Strength-Prediction-using-NLP
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. Make sure you have the SQLite database (`password_data.sqlite`) in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `password_strength_prediction.ipynb`.
2. Call the `predict()` function and enter a password when prompted to check its strength.

### Example:
```python
predict()  # Enter your password when prompted
```

## Data
The project uses a SQLite database (`password_data.sqlite`) containing user passwords and their corresponding strength labels. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## Data Analysis
The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Semantic analysis to categorize passwords based on their characteristics
- Feature engineering to extract relevant features from the password
- Data visualization using box plots and distribution plots

### Distribution Plots
The distribution plots for various features, including the length and frequency of lowercase characters, help visualize how these factors contribute to password strength. Hereâ€™s an example of the distribution plots generated during analysis:

## Model Training
The model is trained using:
- Logistic Regression to classify password strength based on the engineered features.

## Predictions
The model allows users to input passwords and receive real-time predictions regarding their strength.
